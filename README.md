# Calorie-Meter Application
### Android Application which sorts physical activites and counts calories burnt. It also calculates person's Basal Metabolic Rate(BMR) and tells total calories burnt in a day by person.
**Application uses Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) algorithm, a Neural Network method, to classify activites based on previous data.** 
**User freindly UI is made using Android, in which model trained using LSTM is integrated.**

On this project we published paper in Springer named [Human Physical Activities Based Calorie Burn Calculator Using LSTM
